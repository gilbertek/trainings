## Operators - Language Syntax
Operator is something that takes one or more values and produces another value.

#### Data types
Variables in PHP can store/hold data, the data can be of various kind e.g. integer, decimal, etc.

In Php we have,
8 Primitive Datatypes

Four scalar(base) types:
- boolean
- integer
- float (also known as floating-point number or double)
- string

Two compound types:
- array
- object

Two special types:
- resource
- NULL

Boolean data type can have only two values. TRUE or FALSE

Integers can be natural numbers (i.e. 1,2,3 ...), zero or negatives of natural numbers (i.e. -1,-2,-3 ...).

Floating points are also known as double, float and real numbers.

Floating points are noting but fractions (decimal numbers), and can be negative as well as positive numbers.

Double quoted String literals are enclosed with double quote characters (").
Single quoted strings are enclosed with ' (single quote character)

#### List of Operators
1. Operator Precedence
2. Arithmetic Operators
3. Assignment Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Comparison Operators
6. Error Control Operators
7. Execution Operators
8. Incrementing/Decrementing Operators
9. Logical Operators
10. String Operators
11. Array Operators
12. Type Operators

I. Unary operators : Take's only one value.
! (not/negative)
++ (increment operator)
++ (decremental operator)

II. Binary operators: Take's two values.
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
% (moduls) Return the remainder of a division operation
= (equals)
== (boolean comparator operator)
> (boolean greater)
< (boolean less)
&& (boolean AND) (Logical operators)
|| (boolean OR)

III. Ternary operator: Take's three values.
value 1 ? value 2 : value 3


#### Operator Precedence
Defines the order in which the operators are evaluated by PHP
We change the order of execution by using parentheses.

#### Exerxise One
Perform the following operations
3 + 4 * 3
(3 + 4) * 3
