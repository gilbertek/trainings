## Object Oriented Programming
The real world is full of objects like the trees, birds, humans , buildings, computers , mobile phones etc.

In Object Oriented Programming concepts we consider everything as Objects

#### PHP Classes
A class is noting but a Blue-print of an Object.

We can create Objects by instantiating a Class.

A class is made up of two things,

 1. Member Variables

    - Member Variables are the variables that are defined inside a class.
    - These variables are invisible to the outside of the class.
    - We can access Member variables via member functions.


 2. Member Functions

    - Member Functions are the functions that are defined inside a class.
    - We can access member functions by creating object of the class.
